## 🎨 How I Created the Avatar on My Homepage

If you’re wondering where my little character came from — I made it using the free and super fun tool called [Notion Avatar Maker](https://notion-avatar.app/en)!

<img src="/avatar.png"
     alt="Notion Avatar Screenshot"
     width="200"
     style="display: block; margin: auto; border-radius: 12px;" />

### ✏️ Steps I Took

1. Visited [notion-avatar.app](https://notion-avatar.app/en)
2. Chose face shape, hairstyle, and accessories that felt most like me.
   <img src="/random-avatar.png"
        alt="Random Notion Avatar Screenshot"
        width="700"
        style="display: block; margin: auto; border-radius: 12px;" />
3. Downloaded the avatar as a transparent `.png`
4. Added it to my site.
