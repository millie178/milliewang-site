## 🎧 Podcasts I Love

Here’s a collection of data analytics podcasts I enjoy — for learning, relaxing, or just staying inspired.

### 🎙️ **Analytics Power Hour**

     alt="the analytics power hour podcast screenshot"
     width="600"
     style="display: block; margin: auto; border-radius: 12px;" />
**⏱️ Length:** around 60 minutes per episode  
**🎯 Topics:** Real-world analytics practice, measurement strategy, data culture, and organizational dynamics  
**🎙 Hosts:** Tim Wilson, Moe Kiss, and others

**Why I like it:**  
This podcast feels like sitting in on a smart, funny, and honest conversation between analytics professionals who actually _do the work_. They talk about the messy, human side of analytics — not just tools and dashboards, but things like stakeholder relationships, imposter syndrome, and how to build a good team.

**Who it's for:**  
Analytics practitioners who care about how their work fits into larger business and human contexts. Especially valuable if you're in digital analytics, product analytics, or consulting.

     style="display: block; margin: auto; border-radius: 12px;" />
**⏱️ Length:** ~30–60 minutes per episode  
**🎯 Topics:** Machine learning, data science careers, technical deep dives, AI trends  
**🎙 Hosts:** Jon Krohn

**Why I like it:**  
This podcast is more structured and technical than Analytics Power Hour. I like listening to talks with data scientists from all sorts of backgrounds — academia, startups, big tech — and hearing how they approach projects, learn new skills, or pivot careers.

**Who it's for:**  
Anyone studying or working in data science or machine learning. Great for students, job switchers, or professionals who want to hear how others build careers in data.
